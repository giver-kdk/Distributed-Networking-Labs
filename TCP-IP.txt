- IPv6: 
  - If each and every human cell is assigned with IPv6 then also IPv6 will be more.

- NAT: 
  - Convert public network to private? 

IP Types: 
  - Unicast IP
  - Anycast IP 
  - Multicast IP (Broadcast to particular group)
  - Broadcast IP

In IPv4, network is identified using subnet mask: 
  - Class A:
    - 255.0.0.0
  - Class B: 
    - 255.255.0.0
  - Class C:
    - 255.255.255.0

In IPv6, network is identified using 

- 0.0.0.0 is the Default Gateway
- 127.0.0.0 is lookback IP

- In 192.168.0.0/26
  - Total length is 32 bit
  - 26 means network address length in bits
  - Remaining 32-26 = 6 bit is used as host address (which is modifiable)
