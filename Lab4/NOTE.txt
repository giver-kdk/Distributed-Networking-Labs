Steps: 
    - Create the network of switch, router and client as shown in the .pkt project file
        - Connect same devices with cross over wire (Dashed Wire). i.e; Router to Router
    - Assign IP address on client, switch and routes
        - Note that routers have two addresses (GigabitEthernet)
        - The IP addresses for given project is: 
            - Client 1 (192.168.1.2)  
            - Router 1 (192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1)  
            - Router 2 (192.168.2.2, 192.168.3.1)  
            - Client 2 (192.168.3.2)

    - Set default gateway for Client1 = 1st IP Address of Router 1 
    - Set default gateway for Client2 = 2nd IP Address of Router 2 

    - Turn on 'Port Status' for Rouert 1 and Router 2 for both addresses (GigabitEthernet)
    - Now, from Client 1, ping the Client 2 using: 
        - ping 192.168.3.2

    - You should see the data transfer logs
