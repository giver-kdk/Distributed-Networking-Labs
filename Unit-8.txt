- Grid Computing
- Revise Replay Attack
- Revise RSA Based Digital Signature Generation (Might ask in exam)  
  - NOTE: Message size should be less than 'n'
  - If Message size > 'n', then breakdown the messgae into characters
  - Given p and q as prime numbers
  - Find n = p * q
  - Phi(n) = ...
  - 1 < e < Phi(n) gcd(2, Phi(n)) = 1
