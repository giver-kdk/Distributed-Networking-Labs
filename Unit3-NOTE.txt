- Steps of Communication: 
	- Inter Process Communication: 
		- Process identifies via Socket (IP(32-bit) + Port(16-bit))

	- Event Synchronization

	- Abstraction

- Message Passing Paradigm: 
	- Message request is created for RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
	- Message goes to Message System
	- Then Goes to Message Queue
		- Checks if Queue Buffer is full or not
		- If Queue Buffer is not full, then Message goes from Message System to Message Queue
		- Then the Message goes to Server
	- Server returns the Response Message to Message System
		- Then Message goes to the Client


Napster: 
	- Uses Centralized Server
	- Had the issue of central point of failure
Nutella Protocol: 
	- Uses P2P architecture
Kazaa
	- Uses P2P architecture
	- It used Master Node which has more than 10 - 100 nodes connected together.
	- Master node was more powerful node for file searching, directing peers to each other, etc.
- Software Defined Network(SDN) is used to control all the OS of the devices. Eg: Make configuration in SDN and it is applied to all the network devices.
