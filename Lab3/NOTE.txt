- If two or more devices communicate over the network, then it is Client Server Architecture
- Distributed Network heavily relies on Client Server Architecture
- The Client Server Architecture works on TCP/IP or OSI Model protocol
	- Get data
	- Make Segment (Append Port Address)
	- Make packet (Append IP)
	- Make Frame (Append MAC Address)
	- Make Bits
	- Transfer from Source to Destination
	- IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority) is used
- The Client Server Architecture has the challenge at testing phase. 
	- ICMP(Internet Communication Message Protocol) is used for Testing
	- Testing of network considers: 
		- Openness
		- Heterogeneity
		- Reliability (Network might get Down)
		- DDOS Attack (So, Cryptography needed)
		- Man in the Middle Attack (Diffie Hellman Protocol used)
		- Platform Variation and Concurrency(So, DOS is needed and NOS helps to maintain Syntax, Semantic and Timing)
		- Scalability
		- Transparency (Maintained by Distributed Networking)
			- Location
			- User
			- Failure
			- Fault
			- Security
			- Access, etc.
		- Performance
		- Security
	- We do ping for testing
- The debugging phase considers:
